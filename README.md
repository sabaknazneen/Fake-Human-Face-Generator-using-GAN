In our project, we have tried to implement generative 
adversarial networks in a very classic way with new and 
latest tools and technologies. we are trying to implement 
our generative adversarial network to generate fake human 
faces. Our generator and discriminator will use the keras’s 
classic sequential modeling. 

CONCLUSION:
From our result and the loss function, we can see that, we 
successfully created human faces from random noises 
using limited computational power. However, the images 
are not as good as the real life images. Overall, using our 
low computational power we have tried to generate real 
life fake human faces. For comparing this model’s results 
and to see how it reacts with different sizes of images we 
have tested it with three different sizes. At first, we tested it 
using 48 * 48 sizes. At that time, the model did not give 
that much good result though it generated fake human 
faces having noises. And then, to improve the quality we 
used 100*100 sizes. This time, the model performed quite 
well, where it gave quite a good result. When we used 
100*100 sizes of the generated images were very clear and 
understandable. To get a better result, we then used 
150*150 images. This time the model gave comparatively 
better results than the previous two models. Each time we 
ran our model at 100000 epochs. 
Fake images can be used by police to track down people 
who are involved in adultery.  
As we know nowadays child and underage pornography is 
alarming. To catch such people we can use computer 
generated fake faces, that will be more ethical than  using 
real images .  
As we can see nowadays creating fake or edited images is 
very easy. To identify these kinds of images, we can build a 
50 
model. For this model to be trained we can use the 
computer generated images to identify the real and fake 
images.  
We use the fake computer generated images in v
